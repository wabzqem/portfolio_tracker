# Quick Setup Checklist for Public Releases

## ‚òëÔ∏è Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create Public Repository
- [ ] Go to https://github.com/new
- [ ] Name: `portfolio-tracker-releases` (or `portfolio-tracker-downloads`)
- [ ] Make it **PUBLIC** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Initialize with README
- [ ] Create repository

### 2. Create Personal Access Token
- [ ] Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
- [ ] Generate new token (classic)
- [ ] Name: "Portfolio Tracker Releases"
- [ ] Scopes: Check `repo` and `workflow`
- [ ] Generate and **COPY THE TOKEN**

### 3. Add Token to Private Repo
- [ ] Go to https://github.com/wabzqem/portfolio-tracker
- [ ] Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
- [ ] New repository secret
- [ ] Name: `RELEASE_TOKEN`
- [ ] Value: Paste your token
- [ ] Add secret

### 4. Update Workflow File
- [ ] Edit `.github/workflows/release-public.yml`
- [ ] Change line 85: `repository: wabzqem/portfolio-tracker-releases`
  - Replace with your actual public repo name
- [ ] Save and commit

### 5. Set Up Public Repository Content
In your **public** repo:
- [ ] Copy `PUBLIC_REPO_README.md` as `README.md`
- [ ] Copy `INSTALL_MACOS.md` 
- [ ] Copy `MACOS_FIX.md`
- [ ] Copy `DOWNLOAD.md`
- [ ] Commit all files

### 6. Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)
- [ ] In public repo: Settings ‚Üí Pages
- [ ] Source: Deploy from a branch
- [ ] Branch: `main` / root
- [ ] Save
- [ ] Copy `PUBLIC_REPO_INDEX.html` as `index.html` in public repo
- [ ] Commit and push

### 7. Test the Setup
In your **private** repo:
```bash
# Commit workflow changes
git add .github/workflows/release-public.yml
git commit -m "Add public releases workflow"
git push origin main

# Create a test release
git tag v0.0.4
git push origin --tags
```

- [ ] Watch Actions tab (should succeed)
- [ ] Check public repo for new release
- [ ] Download and test installers
- [ ] Check GitHub Pages site (if enabled)

### 8. Update Both Workflows
You now have two workflows:
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Builds on every push to main
- `.github/workflows/release-public.yml` - Publishes releases to public repo

Options:
- **Keep both**: Regular builds stay private, releases go public
- **Use only release-public**: Only build when you create a tag
  - If choosing this, delete or disable `build.yml`

## Quick Commands Reference

### In Private Repo (Development):
```bash
# Regular development work
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main

# Create a public release
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin --tags
```

### In Public Repo (Documentation):
```bash
# Clone public repo
git clone git@github.com:wabzqem/portfolio-tracker-releases.git

# Update docs
cd portfolio-tracker-releases
# Edit README.md, index.html, etc.
git add .
git commit -m "Update documentation"
git push
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Public repo exists and is public
- [ ] Token is added to private repo secrets
- [ ] Workflow file has correct repository name
- [ ] Test release created successfully
- [ ] Installers appear in public repo releases
- [ ] GitHub Pages site works (if enabled)
- [ ] Download links work
- [ ] Installation instructions are clear

## Troubleshooting

### "Resource not accessible by integration"
- Check that RELEASE_TOKEN is set correctly
- Verify token has `repo` scope
- Ensure token hasn't expired

### "Bad credentials"
- Token might be expired
- Create a new token
- Update RELEASE_TOKEN secret

### Releases not appearing in public repo
- Check Actions logs for errors
- Verify repository name in workflow
- Ensure public repo exists and is accessible

### GitHub Pages not working
- Enable Pages in public repo settings
- Make sure `index.html` is in root of main branch
- Wait a few minutes for deployment

## Next Steps After Setup

1. Customize the README in your public repo
2. Update index.html with your branding
